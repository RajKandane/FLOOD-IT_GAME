## Introduction

Flood-It_Game is a popular one-player puzzle game played on many smartphones. The player is presented with an n x n board of tiles, each assigned one of six colors (numbered 1-6). The goal is to change all the tiles to the same color, starting from the upper-left corner, preferably using the fewest number of moves.

The game follows a simple greedy strategy, where the player chooses the color that results in the largest number of tiles connected to the origin (the upper-left corner). In case of a tie, the player selects the lowest numbered color.

## Gameplay

1. The game starts with an n x n board of tiles, each colored with digits 1-6.
2. The player makes a move by choosing one of the six colors.
3. After the move, all tiles connected to the origin with the chosen color are changed to that color.
4. The game continues until all tiles have the same color.

## Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of input is a single integer, not more than 20, indicating the number of test cases to follow. Each case starts with a line containing the integer n (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 20). The next n lines each contain n characters, representing the initial colors of the n x n board of tiles. Each color is specified by a digit from 1 to 6.

## Output

For each case, the program displays two lines of output. The first line specifies the number of moves needed to change all the tiles to the same color. The second line specifies 6 integers separated by a single space. The ith integer gives the number of times color i is chosen as a move in the game.
